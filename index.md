### CPSC 120


Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 was a favorite because it taught me how important formatting was. I remember vividly struggling with formatting with this particular lab due to how many extra spaces and incorrect sign placement. It also taught me how to use double and float, and working with negative numbers.

Lab 7

    Lab 7 was a favorite because It taught me how important understanding time and interpreting it into code was. I was able to understand the 24 hour timezone. It also taught me how to write functions that limit within a certain time frame, and use input validation.

Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was also a favorite because i think the concept in general is very fun even if its basic. It taught me a basic understanding of file I/O and vectors. It also taught me how I/O affects code and its importance within reading data within files.
